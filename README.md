# Quantum-Inspired Obfuscated C Code for OOCCC

This repository explores quantum-inspired techniques for generating unique, obfuscated C code submissions for the **Official Obfuscated C Code Contest (OOCCC)**. By applying concepts like **superposition**, **entanglement**, and **probabilistic transitions**, each submission becomes increasingly complex, leveraging a quantum-like approach to yield beautiful and cryptic code year after year.

## Introduction

Traditional C code focuses on clear, deterministic operations, whereas **quantum computing** involves states and transitions that can be both simultaneous and probabilistic. This project applies a quantum-inspired expansion model to C code, creating **multi-layered, intricate structures** that mirror the behaviors of superposition and entanglement in a classical environment. The result is an evolving collection of obfuscated C code that’s engaging and innovative.

## Goals

Each year, this repository aims to:
- Produce new, obfuscated C code based on quantum principles.
- Maintain a consistent theme while adding unique layers of complexity.
- Leverage rotating quantum behaviors to keep code fresh and challenging.

## Quantum Principles Applied

The code obfuscation process uses three main quantum-inspired principles:
1. **Superposition**: Simulate multiple states using bitwise operations and conditional branching, creating an impression of “simultaneous” state occupancy.
2. **Entanglement**: Introduce dependencies between states where modifying one variable affects others, emulating the quantum concept of entangled states.
3. **Probabilistic Transitions**: Add controlled randomness to mimic quantum measurement’s probabilistic outcomes, ensuring each code pathway appears unpredictable.

## Structure

The project follows an iterative approach, with each year’s submission expanding on previous entries by:
- **Adding Complexity Layers**: Each year, we start with a foundational structure and add new, quantum-inspired elements for deeper obfuscation.
- **Rotating Focus Among Principles**: We alternate focus between superposition, entanglement, and probabilistic transitions to provide a unique style annually.
- **Expanding State Space**: Each submission increases the potential state configurations, adding both to the code’s depth and its cryptic appearance.

## Example Structure

The core code structure uses modular functions representing each quantum-inspired behavior. Below is a foundational example that forms the basis of each entry:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

// Base state functions for quantum behaviors
int superposition(int state) {
    return (state ^ 0b1010) | (state & 0b0101);
}

int entangled_state(int *a, int *b) {
    *a = *a ^ *b;
    *b = *b ^ *a;
    return *a & *b;
}

int probabilistic_transition(int state) {
    return state ^ (rand() % 16);  // Introduce randomness in state transitions
}

void obfuscated_function(int iterations) {
    int state = rand() % 16;
    for (int i = 0; i < iterations; i++) {
        state = superposition(state);
        if (i % 2 == 0) state = entangled_state(&state, &iterations);
        state = probabilistic_transition(state);
    }
    printf("Final state: %d\n", state);
}

int main() {
    srand(time(NULL));
    obfuscated_function(10);
    return 0;
}
```

Each year, we modify:
- **Bitwise Logic** in `superposition`.
- **Variable Dependencies** in `entangled_state`.
- **Random Transitions** in `probabilistic_transition`.

By evolving these functions annually, we ensure that each year’s entry is cryptic yet familiar, using consistent quantum principles while adding unique layers of complexity.

## Running the Code

To compile and run the code, use:
```bash
gcc quantum_obfuscated.c -o quantum_obfuscated
./quantum_obfuscated
```

## Future Development

Planned updates for each yearly entry include:
- **Increased State Space**: Expanding bit-length and configurations to simulate more complex “quantum states.”
- **Recursive Patterns**: Introducing recursive elements to deepen obfuscation.
- **Dynamic Code Generation**: Using macros and inline functions to automate obfuscation patterns with subtle variations.

## Contributing

Feel free to submit ideas or improvements that enhance the quantum-inspired obfuscation model. Each contribution should maintain the quantum principles while pushing the boundaries of complexity and innovation.
